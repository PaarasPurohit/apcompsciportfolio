We found many API's on motivational quotes, so we did that. Our app had many bugs, however. First of all, we did not have a clear understanding of the API system and how it worked, which set us back. Secondly, some of the features did not work. Our front end was also made with too much haste, causing our app to fail in a lot of places. Our presentation, however (done by me), went pretty well. Overall, I liked the experience and because of the mistakes we made, I know exactly all what I need to do to succeed in the liater</p>

One I saw was a compilation of games remade by the students themselves.</p>
