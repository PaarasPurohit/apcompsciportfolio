<p>Conditionals can be shown through binary numbers as well. In many instances, programmers refer to the binary number 0 as false, and the binary number 1 as true. This is also used in the transistors of computers. Binary logic is not just used for number logic, but it is also used to tell true and false. A recap of conditionals:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>AND:
1 and 1 = 1
1 and 0 = 0
0 and 0 = 0</p>
</li>
<li><p>OR:
1 or 1 = 1
1 or 0 = 1
0 or 0 = 0</p>
</li>
<li><p>EXCLUSIVE-OR
1 xor 1 = 0
0 xor 0 = 0
1 xor 0 = 1</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A note about XOR: In case the pattern was clear, XOR is a conditional in where it returns true if both parts are true and false, or false and true, but returns false when both parts are true or both parts are false.</p>
