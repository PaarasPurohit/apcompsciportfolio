<p>I only got one question wrong.</p>
<p>Question:</p>
<p>A computer scientist is analyzing four different algorithms used to sort a list. The table below shows the number of steps each algorithm took to sort lists of different sizes.</p>
<p>List Size<br>
Number of Steps</p>
<p>for Algorithm A</p>
<p>Number of Steps</p>
<p>for Algorithm B</p>
<p>Number of Steps</p>
<p>for Algorithm C</p>
<p>Number of Steps</p>
<p>for Algorithm D</p>
<p>1   10  2   1   1
2   20  4   2   4
3   30  8   6   9
4   40  16  24  16
5   50  32  120 25
Based on the values in the table, which of the algorithms appear to run in reasonable time?</p>
<p>Select two answers.</p>

<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>I said the answer was Algorithm B. The actual answer was A and D.</p>

<div class="cell border-box-sizing text_cell rendered"><div class="inner_cell">
<div class="text_cell_render border-box-sizing rendered_html">
<p>As the size of the list grows, the number of steps needed to sort the list grows at an exponential rate, as the number of steps is equal to 2n
 for a list of size n
. This indicates that the algorithm does not run in a reasonable amount of time.</p>
