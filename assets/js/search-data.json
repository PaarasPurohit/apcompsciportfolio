Below is an example of this being done. . list = [10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15] result = [] for i in list: result.insert(0, i) print(result) . [15, 14, 13, 12, 11, 10] . Are there other methods that can be performed on lists? . There are so many methods that can be applied to lists. There are too many for just one page, but they usually help with gathering data from lists, and using that data to solve problems, return certain things, and more. . | .

            "content": "My Score . After taking the test, I answered 50 questions on programming problem-solving as well as computer science connection knowledge (API&#39;s, protocols, how data is shared, etc.). I got 48 of them correct. . The first question I got wrong was about how information is transferred over the Internet. I chose the answer, &quot;The message is broken into two packets. One packet contains the data to be transmitted and the other packet contains metadata for routing the data to the recipient’s device.&quot; The correct answer was, &quot;The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.&quot; The reason I did not get this correct is because of my lack of knowledge on the subject. This was under a unit that I apparently did not study very well, and caused me to get the answer wrong. My plan to improve in the future is to study and quiz myself and have my friends quiz me on questions that are not cheating on tests. . The second question that I got wrong was the question, &quot;Consider the following code segment. What are the values of first and second as a result of executing the code segment?&quot; The code looked like this: . first = True second = False second = first first = second . I picked the answer, &quot;The value of first is false, and the value of second is true.&quot; As shown below by printing both values, that answer was wrong. . first = True second = False second = first first = second print(first) print(second) . True True . This is a logic proven by a concept called variable swapping. The following code incorrectly swaps variables. . def swap(x, y): x = y y = x print(str(x) + &quot;, &quot; +str(y)) a = 4 b = 2 swap(a, b) . 2, 2 . This is because when x is set to y, x loses its original value, setting both values equal to the original value of y. The following code swaps variables correctly. . def swap(x, y): temp = x x = y y = temp print(str(x) + &quot;, &quot; + str(y)) a = 4 b = 2 swap(a, b) . 2, 4 . The improvement that I can do to avoid these mistakes is to look over the code twice. .",

            "content": "AJ&#39;s Story in Programming . I don&#39;t have a very long history in programming. My first encounter was a coding class in 6th grade. It was only for one trimester and all we did was scratch coding but it was honestly fun. It got me more interested than I already was now that I had somewhat of an idea on what it was. My first and I think only project in scratch was a replica of space invaders. It honestly worked pretty well and I was proud of it, but after that trimester I didn&#39;t touch coding for a few years. I never lost interest, I just had other extracurriculars that took the spot instead. in 11th grade (now) I decided to take csp. I have no idea what I want to do after school as a job and coding seems the most interesting to me. I found this website in 10th grade that taught a little coding but I forgot it&#39;s name. Right now I&#39;m kinda clueless in this class and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing the right things in this class but after trying to figure out a piece of code for fun I think I&#39;m confident in my choice of this class. I&#39;ll work hard to be able to understand everything going on in this class so I can focus on coding things I enjoy in the future :) . Haoxuan&#39;s Story in Programming . Hi, my name is Haoxuan Tong, and here is a recount of my programming experiences so far. . I started my journey in programming in middle school, where I followed a python guide book to make some small programs such as a random number guessing game and a cypher encode and decoder. Then I attended a course to make several games such as minesweeper and reversi using the tkinter python module. In High School, I attended course to do competitional programming and was able to pass the USACO Bronze division . Now I&#39;m both taking the APCSP course and learning C++ to pass USACO Silver this year. The course so far had been pretty fun, and learning to make websites with github is pretty interesting. I will try to learn more in the future. . Paaras&#39; Story in Programming . As of right now, I am fluent in six programming languages, those being Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether that is impressive or not, it did take a journey to get to where I am now. From a young age, I had a passion to create. I knew that whatever it is that I wanted to do with my life, I wanted to create something, anything, that people could enjoy together. My dad found himself working in job that was reliant on computer science, and he did his best to pass his skills to me. Therefore, I started to learn Python at a young age, and around seven, I had a very basic understanding of how programming in Python worked. But, like a lot of programmers in a single-digit age, I started out block coding in Scratch. This programming in Scratch and little knowledge in Python continued for a while. When middle school started, I found myself in a programming club after school, and that is where I started to expand my knowledge of programming. I finished the basics of Python, leaving me with the skills to be fluent enough in the language. Then, I self-taught myself HTML, JavaScript, then CSS. After that, I moved to C++, then back to Python for a while, then Java, to C#, then after C#, I moved on to 6 different languages that I eventually forgot. After sitting with these languages for a while, I came across the means to start making video games with the programming knowledge I had. I followed courses and books on these, and won a few competitions with my new game development skills. After that, I stopped programming for a while, and the only programming I did was solving problems on a competitive level every week or so. I then joined AP Computer Science Principles, hoping to put my programming skills to better use, and I hope to use the skills I learn in this class and do more in the future. . While on the path I took, there are some things you learn. For example, don&#39;t be a programmer. Programming languages are just tools to do bigger things. Being fluent in a wide array of languages is like being able to use a lot of construction tools, like hammers and wrenches. Be a problem solver. Demonstrate that you can use the tools, the programming languages, to do bigger things, such as create things, solve problems, and make differences. Thank you for listening to our stories, and good luck with your journey! .",

First of all, we did not have a clear understanding of the API system and how it worked, which set us back. Secondly, some of the features did not work. Our front end was also made with too much haste, causing our app to fail in a lot of places. Our presentation, however (done by me), went pretty well.

I&#39;m glad you asked. This gives me an opportunity to bring up a point that is important about data abstraction. When programmers say that lists make code easier, others think that lists are the key to have a relaxing time programming. This is a completely wrong thing to think, because programs, regardless of lists, can still be hard to code. Abstraction, despite the misconceptions, don&#39;t make code easier, but rather, they make code less prone to errors, which is commonly referred to as making it &quot;simpler.&quot; Something I&#39;ve found while doing the hacks for this lesson. | Make your own list the “long and slow way” then manage the complexity of the list | . food1 = &quot;pizza&quot; food2 = &quot;hot dog&quot; food3 = &quot;sushi&quot; food4 = &quot;strawberry&quot; food5 = &quot;sandwich&quot; foods = [food1, food2, food3, food4, food5] print(foods) .

Express an algorithm that uses iteration without using a programming language | Define an iteration | The Basics Of Iteration | Examples | LESSON Vocab: . Iteration: a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | Before we dive deeper, we need to understand that an iteration is a part of an algorithm. And in that iteration is a set of instructions that need to be followed until a certain desired output is met. . Examples . Here is an example using online shopping: . . Lets say you are looking for a lost item inside of your house... What steps would you take? . Suppose there are n rooms to search... number the rooms 1-n . | Start by searching in room number 1 . | Search each room thoroughly for you item. . | Change the room number to the next highest number . | Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you have found your lost item. . | Enjoy the lost item. . | WAIT! There is a flaw in the program. . This is where a stopping condition is useful for when the iteration already meets the desired requirement and gets out of the loop. . Programming Examples . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . i = 0 while (i &lt; 5): #Try changing the 5 and see what happens! print(&quot;Hello, World!&quot;) i = i + 1 if (i == 3): #Try Changing the 3 and see what happens! break . Hello, World! Hello, World! Hello, World! . These are just a few examples of what you can do with iteration. . Summary: . An Iteration is a repeating portion of an algorithm, repeats a specified number of times or until a given condition is met | We can use stopping conditions to stop an iteration if a condition is already met | . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.2 - Parav Salaniwal . Lesson Objectives . Determine the result or side effect of iteration statements | Learn how to use iterations with for loops and while loops | Creating code to learn how to incrementally list numbers | Learn the range function and using variables in code | . Definition: Iteration Statement - cause statements to be executed zero or more times, subject to some loop-termination criteria . The first function we will learn is the range function, which we will use with for loop. As you may be able to guess, this will give us the sum based on the input provided. We always use a variable, such as i, to represent what the range of numbers the output will show. For example, if I wanted to list the numbers from 1-10 using the range function, it would look like this: . for i in range(11): print(i) . 0 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Now the first thing you may notice is my input for the range was 11, and you may wonder why is it not 10? This is because when using the range function, the last number, or the ending value, is not included in the output, therefore we would have to add 1 to receive the correct output. Now if we were looking to include a starting value to have it start from 1 and end at 10, the code would look like this: . for i in range(1,11): print(i) . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . When using the range with for loop, the you can list much more than just a increment of one, would anyone like to guess how we could include a change in the incremented value? Try making a change in the python code above to change the incremented value. When using the range function: . for i in range(starting value, ending value, incremented value): print(i) . Now with while loops, we can provide a similar output with a variation in the input. Similar to for loops, it requires a variable which is the starting value. . i=1 while i&lt;=10: print(i) i=i+1 . 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 . Based on your knowledge from for loops, which values in the code above are the starting, incrementing, and ending values? . LESSON . . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 . Unit 3 Section 3.8.3 - Nikhil . Here is some basic code I have created, let&#39;s first look into this one: I created a list of pets, cat, dog, fish, and snake. Then I created a for loop, &quot;for i in pets&quot; and this looks at every element/value in pets, so &quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot; and &quot;snake&quot;. This next if statmenets checks if the element in the list is &quot;fish&quot; and if it is, it breaks the loop. The statement would just print, cat and dog since the loop breaks at fish. . pets = [&quot;cat&quot;, &quot;dog&quot;, &quot;fish&quot;, &quot;snake&quot;] for i in pets: if i == &quot;fish&quot;: break print(i) . cat dog . This while loop checks if number less than 10 is even and if so, it will print out the even numbers. We set a starting value of number = 0, then while the number is less than 10, the percent sign means modulus so meaning if there is a remaninder when we dvide. So if number divided by 2 has no remainder then it will print number. Then after that it will add 1 to the number and repeat the process untill it reaches 10. So let&#39;s check for 0, while 0 is less than ten, then it moves to next statement, since 0 divded by 2 has a remainder of 0 it will print the value of 0. Now it will add 1 to zero. Then it will see that 1 is less than ten, and then check if 1 divided by 2 has a remainder of 0 which it does not, so it skips the print, and goes straight to addding one, so on so forth. . number = 0 while number &lt; 10: if number % 2 == 0: print(number) number += 1 . 0 2 4 6 8 . The purpose of this code is to find the sum of all the even numbers between and any number of your choosing. The integer input asks for the minimum and maximum value. The next statement puts a starting sum value set to 0. The for i in range (minimum,maximum+1) looks at every number between those two values, in this case 1 and 100. Then the if i modulus 2 checks if any numbers that are divisible by 2 and the remainder comes to 0. If there is a number that has a remainder of 0 when divided by 2, it adds that number to the sum. Then the last print statement, prints out the final sum of all even numbers between the two numbers of your choosing. . minimum = int(input(&quot;please enter a minimum number you want your range to be&quot;)) maximum = int(input(&quot;please enter a number that you want to be the maximum value&quot;)) sum = 0 for i in range(minimum,maximum+1): if i % 2 == 0: sum += i print(&quot;The sum of all the even numbers between&quot;, minimum, &quot;and&quot;, maximum, &quot;:&quot;, sum) . The sum of all the even numbers between 1 and 3 : 2 . LESSON . . HACKS Unit 3 Section 8 . Hacks Unit 3 Section 3.8.1 .

            "content": "What is a Boolean? . In programming, a boolean is a variable type that is either true or false. One can think of a boolean as a button: When it is on, it returns true, and when it is off, it returns false, as shown below: . Boolean . Text . Booleans are compatible with something called relational operators. This means that booleans can be compared to each other with said relational operators, shown in the code below: . if 1 == 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Not equal to&quot; checks if two booleans do not have the same value. if 1 != 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Greater than&quot; checks if a boolean is greater than another. if 1 &gt; 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Less than&quot; checks if a boolean is less than another. if 1 &lt; 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Greater than or equal to&quot; checks if a boolean is greater than or equal to another if 1 &gt;= 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Less than&quot; checks if a boolean is less than or equal to another. if 1 &lt;= 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) .

In the code above, &quot;1 &lt;= 0&quot; was a boolean that has the value of False, since the number 1 is neither less than or equal to the number 0. However, it should be mentioned that in programming, boolean works for all variable types, such as a string, as shown in the code below: . first_message = &quot;Hello World&quot; second_message = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; if first_message == second_message: print(&quot;The two messages are the same&quot;) else: print(&quot;The two messages are not the same&quot;) .

            "content": "Conditionals can be shown through binary numbers as well. In many instances, programmers refer to the binary number 0 as false, and the binary number 1 as true. This is also used in the transistors of computers. Binary logic is not just used for number logic, but it is also used to tell true and false. A recap of conditionals: . AND: 1 and 1 = 1 1 and 0 = 0 0 and 0 = 0 . | OR: 1 or 1 = 1 1 or 0 = 1 0 or 0 = 0 . | EXCLUSIVE-OR 1 xor 1 = 0 0 xor 0 = 0 1 xor 0 = 1 . | . A note about XOR: In case the pattern was clear, XOR is a conditional in where it returns true if both parts are true and false, or false and true, but returns false when both parts are true or both parts are false. .",

            "content": "Here is the video that we made . Another Thing About Udderly Delectable&#39;s Journey . While I did not mention it in the video, because it was not in the instructions, I do want to take this time to mention that while we are not always the best at getting things done correctly, we have come a long way. Our purpose has changed a total of _ times. We were first a product placement for milk, then a nutrition promotion website, then a product placement of KFC, then finally we became Inspirivational. My grade dropped in this class, and so did our teams. But while I was working to get my scores up, I realized something. While failing is not a pleasant thing to do, in a way, I&#39;m glad I did. There were indeed those who rejected me because of my failures, but I realized that because our team was at the bottom, the only way to go was to the top. So I made the promise to my teacher that I will use what I have learned in the class to use my time wisely and finish everything on time, with all instructions complete. I also promised my teacher that I will give my best and most visible effort to having a strong finish in this trimester. It really could be anyone reading this, so I want you, reader, to know that you don&#39;t necessarily have to fail, but you&#39;re going to. You&#39;re also not going to like it. But if you want to be great, then you won&#39;t be in that position for long. Something is gonna happen in your life that will help you get to the top. It&#39;ll take your time and effort, but it&#39;ll be worth it. Thank you for reading. .",

            "title": "Qualcomm Presentation",
            "content": "Intro to Engineering: . Engineering is the concept of using scientific and mathematic principles to solve problems. There are many types of engineering. There&#39;s mechanical, software, civil, aeronautical, biotech, and so much more. Each branch interests different people, and the speakers did mention the process of elimination. Every person has their own experiences in learning engineering, so we can all learn from each other. In this presentation, the speakers highlight women in science. There are still a lot of places where women are unfairly not taken seriously in engineering. But with engineers, it takes anyone, no matter who, to take an interest in any of the branches of engineering. Like many other concepts, engineering takes dedication, passion, and hard work, and those who feel happy doing it will excel in it. I asked the question, &quot;What universities specialize in software engineering? In those universities, what are the majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm)? What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into them?&quot; The answer I got from one of the speakers was academic rigor. Besides the SAT and ACT, going above in beyond in school, meaning: taking AP classes relevant to software engineering, participating in clubs relevant to S.E, taking relevant courses at the school&#39;s associated community college, and more. I am currently doing all of these, but it was nice to hear that I am doing the right things, and motivating to listen to. Another question I had was, &quot;I am at a point where I am fluent in about 7 programming languages, and have a good understanding of problem solving - understanding the problem and also understanding what concepts are needed to solve them (I think that&#39;s correct). I actually moved to this city just in July, one of the reasons being the opportunities present in engineering. What are some competitions that I can participate in where I can apply what I&#39;ve learned?&quot; The answers I got was taking part in the robotics club at my school, and also looking into the local companies to see if they hire high schoolers as interns, student employees, etc. Overall, I really liked this presentation, and I am excited for the next one. . Intersections of Business and STEM at Qualcomm: . There are three tenets to the business and stem: The first is to stay curious. A growth mindset, especially in STEM and business at a place like Qualcomm, will take a STEM student very far. One in this field must expose themselves to every field in STEM before choosing one career path. Doing this also helps to land dream jobs. The second, as I recall it, was to not give up. There will be many difficulties in the STEM career process, but one must keep perservering, because that perserverance will always pay off in the end. The third and final tenet is the difference between invention and innovation. Invention is creating something unique. Innovation is the tenet of looking at the end during the beginning. That means identifying a goal that can be achieved with the skills one has, and solving problems to achieve the goal. The presentation was really fun, and I made sure to participate during the presentation. I learned a lot about the fundamental skills of STEM and business in working with a company such as Qualcomm. .",

We may change our purpose in the future, but for now, this is our purpose . | Data Abstraction, Managing Complexity, and Procedural Abstraction - With the use of JSON API&#39;s, we store data relevant to our purpose to use later for both frontend and backend development . | Algorithm Implimentation - We are planning on using algorithms to make interactive features on our application that will help the user get hooked to purchasing from KFC . | Testing - As the DevOps, I will make sure that the application is ready for deployment once Scrum Master Samarth and I come to a stage where we feel that it is indeed ready. . | .",

As more and more developers use APIs, they build standards in how you setup a client, send requests and receive information... . Covid19 RapidAPI Example . To begin the API journey. You need to find an API provider. . RapidAPI is a great option. You must setup and account, but there are many free options. | Goto this page for starters, the Corona virus World and India data- Under Code Snippets pick Python - Requests | . RapidAPI, you will select Python Requests type of code to work with you Notebook. . The url is the endpoint to which the API is directed | The headers is a dictionary data structure to send special messaging to the endpoint | The requests.request() python function is used to send a request and retrieve their responses | The response variable receives result of of the request in JSON text | . Next step, is to format the response according to your data science needs . import requests url = &quot;https://spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.rapidapi.com/recipes/complexSearch&quot; querystring = {&quot;query&quot;:&quot;pasta&quot;,&quot;cuisine&quot;:&quot;italian&quot;,&quot;excludeCuisine&quot;:&quot;greek&quot;,&quot;diet&quot;: &quot;vegetarian&quot;,&quot;intolerances&quot;:&quot;gluten&quot;,&quot;equipment&quot;:&quot;pan&quot;,&quot;includeIngredients&quot;: &quot;tomato,cheese&quot;,&quot;excludeIngredients&quot;:&quot;eggs&quot;,&quot;type&quot;:&quot;main course&quot;, &quot;instructionsRequired&quot;:&quot;true&quot;,&quot;fillIngredients&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;addRecipeInformation&quot;: &quot;false&quot;,&quot;titleMatch&quot;:&quot;Crock Pot&quot;,&quot;maxReadyTime&quot;:&quot;20&quot;,&quot;ignorePantry&quot;:&quot;true&quot;, &quot;sort&quot;:&quot;calories&quot;,&quot;sortDirection&quot;:&quot;asc&quot;,&quot;minCarbs&quot;:&quot;10&quot;,&quot;maxCarbs&quot;:&quot;100&quot;, &quot;minProtein&quot;:&quot;10&quot;,&quot;maxProtein&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minCalories&quot;:&quot;50&quot;,&quot;maxCalories&quot;:&quot;800&quot;, &quot;minFat&quot;:&quot;10&quot;,&quot;maxFat&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minAlcohol&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxAlcohol&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minCaffeine&quot;: &quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxCaffeine&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minCopper&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxCopper&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minCalcium&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxCalcium&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minCholine&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxCholine&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minCholesterol&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxCholesterol&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minFluoride&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxFluoride&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minSaturatedFat&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxSaturatedFat&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminA&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminA&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminC&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminC&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminD&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminD&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminE&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminE&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminK&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminK&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminB1&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminB1&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminB2&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminB2&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminB5&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminB5&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminB3&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminB3&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminB6&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminB6&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minVitaminB12&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxVitaminB12&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minFiber&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxFiber&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minFolate&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxFolate&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minFolicAcid&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxFolicAcid&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minIodine&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxIodine&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minIron&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxIron&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minMagnesium&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxMagnesium&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minManganese&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxManganese&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minPhosphorus&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxPhosphorus&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minPotassium&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxPotassium&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minSelenium&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxSelenium&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minSodium&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxSodium&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minSugar&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxSugar&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;minZinc&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;maxZinc&quot;:&quot;100&quot;,&quot;offset&quot;:&quot;0&quot;,&quot;number&quot;:&quot;10&quot;,&quot;limitLicense&quot;:&quot;false&quot;,&quot;ranking&quot;:&quot;2&quot;} headers = { &quot;X-RapidAPI-Key&quot;: &quot;f9e05fed4fmshda97f8933d9e076p192198jsn5018f8cb51c3&quot;, &quot;X-RapidAPI-Host&quot;: &quot;spoonacular-recipe-food-nutrition-v1.p.rapidapi.com&quot; } response = requests.request(&quot;GET&quot;, url, headers=headers, params=querystring) print(response.text) # This code looks for &quot;world data&quot; print(&quot;World Totals&quot;) world = response.json().get(&#39;world_total&#39;) # turn response to json() so we can extract &quot;world_total&quot; for key, value in world.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) print() # This code looks for USA in &quot;countries_stats&quot; print(&quot;Country Totals&quot;) countries = response.json().get(&#39;countries_stat&#39;) for country in countries: # countries is a list if country[&quot;country_name&quot;] == &quot;USA&quot;: # this filters for USA for key, value in country.items(): # this finds key, value pairs in country print(key, value) . {&#34;message&#34;:&#34;You are not subscribed to this API.&#34;} World Totals .

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | .
