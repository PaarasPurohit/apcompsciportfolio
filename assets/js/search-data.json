            "content": "2.2 Data Compression . Essential Knowledge: . Data compression can reduce the number of bits, or size, of transmitted or stored data | Fewer bits does not necessarily mean less information | The amount of size reduction from compression depends on both the amount of redundancy in the original data representation and the compression algorithm applied | Lossless data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data | Lossy data compression algorithms can significantly reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data | Lossy data compression algorithms can usually reduce the number of bits stored or transmitted more than lossless compression algorithms | In situations where quality or ability to reconstruct the original is maximally important, lossless compression algorithms are typically chosen. | In situations where minimizing data size or transmission time is maximally important, lossy compression algorithms are typically chosen. | . What is Data Compression? . Data compression is a reduction in the number of bits needed to represent data | Data compression is used to save transmission time and storage space | . How Does Compression Work? . When data is compressed, you are looking for repeated patterns and predictability | Example: XXXOOXX = X3O2X2 | The larger the data file, the more patterns that can be pulled out | . Text Compression . Remove all repeated characters and insert a single character or symbol in its place | Example: Twinkle Twinkle Little Star = Little Star | . Data Compression Methods: Lossless Vs. Lossy . Lossless: Reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted while guaranteeing complete reconstruction of the original data. This is used where the removal of small data changes the overall file. | Lossy: Significantly reduces the number of bits stored or transmitted but only allow reconstruction of an approximation of the original data. This is used where the removal of small data removes redundancy. | Example: A detailed sky with multiple shades of blue will be averaged out to one shade of blue in the JPG algorithm. | . Practice Problem . The text given in the practice problem decodes to: Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall, Humpty Dumpty had a great fall, all the king&#39;s horses and all the king&#39;s men, Couldn&#39;t put Humpty together again. . 2.3.1 - Extracting Information from Data . Essential Knowledge . The ability to process data depends on the capabilities of the user and their tools | Data sets pose challenges regardless of size, such as the need to clean data, incomplete data, invalid data, and the need to combine data sources | Depending on how data were collected, they may not be uniform | Cleaning data is a process that makes the data uniform without changing their meaning | Problems of bias are often created by the type or source of data being collected. Bias is not eliminated by simply collecting more data | The size of a data set affects the amount of information that can be extracted from it | Large data sets are difficult to process using a single computer and may require parallel systems | Scalability of systems is an important consideration when working with data sets, as the computational capacity of a system affects how data sets can be processed and stored. | . Where do we start with data? . Collecting data Issues to consider: Source Do you need more sources? | . | Tools to analyze data | . | . | Processing data is affected by size How much information can we get? | Can one computer handle our task? May need to use parallel processing Use two or more processors to handle different parts of the task | Check the scalability of the system. | . | . | . | Is there potential bias? Intentional: Who collected the data? | Do they have an agenda? | . | Unintentional? How is the data collected? | Who collected the data? | . | . | Data Cleaning: Identifying incomplete, corrupt, duplicate, or inaccurate records | Replacing, modifying, or deleting the &quot;dirty&quot; data | . | Be careful about modifying or deleting! Be sure there is a mistake! | Keep records of what data is modified/deleted and WHY | Invalid data may need to be modified - keep form consistent | . | . Practice Problems: . From the sample data shown in the video, here is the data that needs to be modified: . The 10th student ID is missing | The 5th and 9th years in school are not numbers like the rest of the column | The 2nd and 8th GPA&#39;s need to be two decimal places, having zeroes where need be. | The sixth year in school and the fifth GPA are inaccurate. There is no way a high school student is in Year 20, and we can assume that it is highly unlikely that a GPA higher than 4.0 is possible in this scenario | . 2.3.2 - Extracting Information from Data . Essential Knowledge . Information is the collection of facts and patters extracted from data | Data provides opportunities for identifying trends, making connections, and addressing problems | Digitally processed data may show correlation between variables. A correlation found in data does not necessarily indicate that a causal relationship exists. Additional research is needed to understand the exact nature of the relationship. | Often a single source does not contain the data needed to draw conclusion. | Metadata are data about data | Changes and deletions made to metadata do not change the primary data | Metadata are used for finding, organizing, and managing information. | Metadata can increase the effective use of data or data sets by providing additional information | Metadata allow data to be structured and organized. | . What is metadata? . Prefix meta behind, among, between | metadata - data about data | . | Some data has information about itself Author | Date | Length/Size | . | Why? Identify | Track/Organize | Process | . | Example: A photo includes: Date | Time | Location | Height | Width | Pixels | Type of compression | . | . Practice Problems . Metadata in the book mentioned in the video: . Author | Title | Genre | Date of Publication | Length | . How can it be used? . Suggest other books | Organize inventory | . Finding Patterns . Data allows us to gain knowledge: Look for trends | Look for patterns | Answer questions | . | Be Careful! | Look out for misleading trends/patterns | Correlation does not equal causation | . What I Took Away . Data compression - lossless for keeping as much data as possible, lossy for removing all small details - is used to transmit or store data with less bits for storage and time complexity. | Extracting information from data requires programmers to go beyond the data set, using tools such as metadata and additional resources. | .",

            "content": "My Score . After taking the test, I answered 50 questions on programming problem-solving as well as computer science connection knowledge (API&#39;s, protocols, how data is shared, etc.). I got 48 of them correct. . The first question I got wrong was about how information is transferred over the Internet. I chose the answer, &quot;The message is broken into two packets. One packet contains the data to be transmitted and the other packet contains metadata for routing the data to the recipient’s device.&quot; The correct answer was, &quot;The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.&quot; The reason I did not get this correct is because of my lack of knowledge on the subject. This was under a unit that I apparently did not study very well, and caused me to get the answer wrong. My plan to improve in the future is to study and quiz myself and have my friends quiz me on questions that are not cheating on tests. . The second question that I got wrong was the question, &quot;Consider the following code segment. What are the values of first and second as a result of executing the code segment?&quot; The code looked like this: . first = True second = False second = first first = second . I picked the answer, &quot;The value of first is false, and the value of second is true.&quot; As shown below by printing both values, that answer was wrong. . first = True second = False second = first first = second print(first) print(second) . True True . This is a logic proven by a concept called variable swapping. The following code incorrectly swaps variables. . def swap(x, y): x = y y = x print(str(x) + &quot;, &quot; +str(y)) a = 4 b = 2 swap(a, b) . 2, 2 . This is because when x is set to y, x loses its original value, setting both values equal to the original value of y. The following code swaps variables correctly. . def swap(x, y): temp = x x = y y = temp print(str(x) + &quot;, &quot; + str(y)) a = 4 b = 2 swap(a, b) . 2, 4 . The improvement that I can do to avoid these mistakes is to look over the code twice. .",

            "content": "AJ&#39;s Story in Programming . I don&#39;t have a very long history in programming. My first encounter was a coding class in 6th grade. It was only for one trimester and all we did was scratch coding but it was honestly fun. It got me more interested than I already was now that I had somewhat of an idea on what it was. My first and I think only project in scratch was a replica of space invaders. It honestly worked pretty well and I was proud of it, but after that trimester I didn&#39;t touch coding for a few years. I never lost interest, I just had other extracurriculars that took the spot instead. in 11th grade (now) I decided to take csp. I have no idea what I want to do after school as a job and coding seems the most interesting to me. I found this website in 10th grade that taught a little coding but I forgot it&#39;s name. Right now I&#39;m kinda clueless in this class and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing the right things in this class but after trying to figure out a piece of code for fun I think I&#39;m confident in my choice of this class. I&#39;ll work hard to be able to understand everything going on in this class so I can focus on coding things I enjoy in the future :) . Haoxuan&#39;s Story in Programming . Hi, my name is Haoxuan Tong, and here is a recount of my programming experiences so far. . I started my journey in programming in middle school, where I followed a python guide book to make some small programs such as a random number guessing game and a cypher encode and decoder. Then I attended a course to make several games such as minesweeper and reversi using the tkinter python module. In High School, I attended course to do competitional programming and was able to pass the USACO Bronze division . Now I&#39;m both taking the APCSP course and learning C++ to pass USACO Silver this year. The course so far had been pretty fun, and learning to make websites with github is pretty interesting. I will try to learn more in the future. . Paaras&#39; Story in Programming . As of right now, I am fluent in six programming languages, those being Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether that is impressive or not, it did take a journey to get to where I am now. From a young age, I had a passion to create. I knew that whatever it is that I wanted to do with my life, I wanted to create something, anything, that people could enjoy together. My dad found himself working in job that was reliant on computer science, and he did his best to pass his skills to me. Therefore, I started to learn Python at a young age, and around seven, I had a very basic understanding of how programming in Python worked. But, like a lot of programmers in a single-digit age, I started out block coding in Scratch. This programming in Scratch and little knowledge in Python continued for a while. When middle school started, I found myself in a programming club after school, and that is where I started to expand my knowledge of programming. I finished the basics of Python, leaving me with the skills to be fluent enough in the language. Then, I self-taught myself HTML, JavaScript, then CSS. After that, I moved to C++, then back to Python for a while, then Java, to C#, then after C#, I moved on to 6 different languages that I eventually forgot. After sitting with these languages for a while, I came across the means to start making video games with the programming knowledge I had. I followed courses and books on these, and won a few competitions with my new game development skills. After that, I stopped programming for a while, and the only programming I did was solving problems on a competitive level every week or so. I then joined AP Computer Science Principles, hoping to put my programming skills to better use, and I hope to use the skills I learn in this class and do more in the future. . While on the path I took, there are some things you learn. For example, don&#39;t be a programmer. Programming languages are just tools to do bigger things. Being fluent in a wide array of languages is like being able to use a lot of construction tools, like hammers and wrenches. Be a problem solver. Demonstrate that you can use the tools, the programming languages, to do bigger things, such as create things, solve problems, and make differences. Thank you for listening to our stories, and good luck with your journey! .",

            "content": "So this Sunday, I did the installations. The installations from Week 0. I should have done this the minute I found one of my tools not working and the solution was to do exactly that. Mr. Mortensen told me two things over the course of that time: He told me that experimentation is necessary to succeed, and that I should be able to experiment without him supervising all the time. The second thing he told me was that I felt the need to restrict myself, which I analyzed and found one thing to be the cause: procrastination. I put off re-installing and experimenting with environments for months, and that was a wrong thing to do. But yesterday, I just woke up and went straight to doing it. Mr. Mortensen also once let me know that he bought a fresh windows machine and did the installations working first try. After I did the installations, I felt so good. Not only did I just get over fear built on procrastination, but I actually understood what I was doing this time. On Week 0, I was just following instructions, however poorly. This time, I knew all the vocabulary - I knew that we were installing VsCode through the Ubuntu environment, cloning our repositories, and installing the proper kernels needed to complete work in the class. . My advice to people? Stop procrastinating. The only way to do that is to just do it. Everyone is different, and there is a switch that clicks in the brain that allows for us to just do it, and once I clicked and was done with it, I felt so good and satisfied .",

Machine Learning Visit Tutorials Point . Scikit-learn (Sklearn) is the most useful and robust library for machine learning in Python. It provides a selection of efficient tools for machine learning and statistical modeling including classification, regression, clustering and dimensionality reduction via a consistence interface in Python. . Description from ChatGPT. The Titanic dataset is a popular dataset for data analysis and machine learning. In the context of machine learning, accuracy refers to the percentage of correctly classified instances in a set of predictions. In this case, the testing data is a subset of the original Titanic dataset that the decision tree model has not seen during training......After training the decision tree model on the training data, we can evaluate its performance on the testing data by making predictions on the testing data and comparing them to the actual outcomes. The accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data tells us how well the model generalizes to new data that it hasn&#39;t seen before......For example, if the accuracy of the decision tree classifier on the testing data is 0.8 (or 80%), this means that 80% of the predictions made by the model on the testing data were correct....Chance of survival could be done using various machine learning techniques, including decision trees, logistic regression, or support vector machines, among others. . | Code Below prepares data for further analysis and provides an Accuracy. IMO, you would insert a new passenger and predict survival. Datasets could be used on various factors like prediction if a player will hit a Home Run, or a Stock will go up or down. .

I should have done this the minute I found one of my tools not working and the solution was to do exactly that. Mr. Mortensen told me two things over the course of that time: He told me that experimentation is necessary to succeed, and that I should be able to experiment without him supervising all the time. The second thing he told me was that I felt the need to restrict myself, which I analyzed and found one thing to be the cause: procrastination. I put off re-installing and experimenting with environments for months, and that was a wrong thing to do. But yesterday, I just woke up and went straight to doing it. Mr. Mortensen also once let me know that he bought a fresh windows machine and did the installations working first try. After I did the installations, I felt so good. Not only did I just get over fear built on procrastination, but I actually understood what I was doing this time. On Week 0, I was just following instructions, however poorly. This time, I knew all the vocabulary - I knew that we were installing VsCode through the Ubuntu environment, cloning our repositories, and installing the proper kernels needed to complete work in the class. . My advice to people? Stop procrastinating. The only way to do that is to just do it. Everyone is different, and there is a switch that clicks in the brain that allows for us to just do it, and once I clicked and was done with it, I felt so good and satisfied .",

Since our project is very small, we are not in need of a license making it closed-sources, or a license that a company such as Qualcomm might need. The license allows for distribution, modification, commercial use, private and patent use, but also has the conditions that the user has to disclose the source (us), license and copyright notice, have the same license, and state the changes the user has made. The only limitations on the license are the liability and warranty clauses of the project, which is fine for us. | Answered in #1 | Here is our GNU GPLv3 license embedded in our project. | Safe Computing . For our project, our app is not social, meaning that friends of a user cannot view online the user&#39;s statistics. If, however, one were to get access to the database, they would find your name, but they would also find things such as the users age, gender, weight, height, maximum calories, whether or not their calorie limit has been reached for the day, their body-mass-index, their workout routine, and what workouts/sports they do. The only dangerous thing they may find is the user&#39;s password. | I am fine with people knowing my name, face, and general location (city or state, keeping it at that level of vague), but nothing else. | A good password should either be either really long (but the user remembers it) or mixed with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, and special characters. One of my passwords is over 20 characters, for example. | Symmetric encryption is where one key is used for locking and unlocking, and asymmetric is where a public and private key are used. | AWS services use AES-256 encryption, an encrpytion method where a 256-bit key is used to encrypt and decrypt information. | I have never fell for phising, because my goals right now do not pertain to making money the easy ways, but I do get a large amount of spam calls. Occasionally, I will answer them, and the scam is that they pick a service, and tell you that you have either won some prize or that your computer/phone/account is endangered of getting hacked in whatever service they pick. For example, an Amazon scam might choose the problematic route, and send an email &quot;informing&quot; you that you have purchased a very expensive iPhone, and leaving a small enough note somewhere that if you wish to cancel this, call a number. The victim calls the number, says they want to cancel the order of the iPhone, but instead of cancelling the order from the account itself, the scammer will say that the only way to do it is taking control of the phone&#39;s screen and doing it from the app. They won&#39;t say it that directly, or else they would have been out of business by now, but they do convince a lot of elderly and non-technological people. There are two ways to combat this: Either recognize when they want you to download any screen-controlling app (AnyDesk, TeamViewer, etc.) and don&#39;t fall for it but rather waste their time (they deserve it, and they have a very short temper) or just don&#39;t answer calls and ignore emails that are suspicous or that you don&#39;t recognize. Safe computing is very important in this day and age, and this is just one example that proves how necessary it is. |",

            "title": "My Feature Meeting CPT Requirements",
            "content": "Overview . My feature is essentially a calorie counter with two parts to it. . The first is a calorie counter that needs user data to output the amount of calories burned in a day. . The second is a feature that inputs a food and its calories to make a list of foods, and can calculate the total amount of calories consumed. It will also warn the user when they are close to going over their calorie limit. . The value that will be stored in their user account is the max calorie count for that user. . Video Response . Purpose: . The purpose of the overall feature is to solve the problem of an unhealthy lifestyle by calculating daily calorie intake and managing it. | For the first part, using a formula for metabolic rate, depending on the gender, the program will use the user&#39;s age, sex, weight, height, and activity level and produce the output of the user&#39;s maximum calories, letting the user have the option to save this value to their account. For the second part, the program will use the inputs of food name and calorie amount and output a table showing the summative foods put through the day. . | For the first part, the input is the integers sex, age, weight, height, and the multiple-choice activity level (later stored as an integer) of the user. The output is the maximum calories the user can consume daily. For the second part, the input is the name of a food being consumed, and the amount of calories in it. The output is a table showing every food entered in that day, as well as the calories of them all. . | Data Abstraction . The table created acts as a list for both frontend and backend. Food name and calorie amount variables are stored in said table. The sum of the calorie amounts is used to calculate whether or not the user should stop calorie consumption for the day, as shown in the code below. . | The list is the table creation and adding of rows itself, as shown in the code below. . | The data of the food&#39;s name is simply for the user to identify where each calorie amount comes from, but the calorie amounts are added together to check if the user is going over their daily maximum calorie consumption, as shown in the code below. . | If this were not here, the user could not keep track of their daily calorie consumption, meaning that the feature establishes the maximum calorie consumption for the user, but does not help manage the user&#39;s consumption to fit said max calories. The only other way to achieve such a management section would be to create variables for every possible entry, which would be inefficient and a waste of data. . Managing Complexity . There are functions to fetch a JSON list from a user database. The name of the database is the URL inputted into the fetch() method. The program will save the age, gender, weight, height, activity amount, and maximum calorie amount of the user in said database, as shown in the code below: | If this list would not be used, then data would not be saved to the user&#39;s account, and the inputs will have to be repeatedly be inputted each time the user loads the website rather than just a login system, which is inefficient. | Procedural Abstraction . Below is the procedure that calculates the maximum calories that a user can consume in one day: | This procedure is called in the front end of the feature, as shown in the code below: | This function makes one half of the first part of the feature. This takes in the user&#39;s input and returns a value that is later stored in the user&#39;s account in the backend database, contributing to the establishment of the user&#39;s maximum calories - the overall functionality of the feature. | Algorithm Implementation . The functions below respectfully calculate the maximum calorie amount a user can consume daily and save that value to the user&#39;s account in a backend database: . In the function &quot;calculateMaximumCalories()&quot; I started by grabbing the values of sex, age, weight, height, and activity level from the inputs from the frontend, using the built-in &quot;getElementById()&quot; function. Since the formula for calculating maximum calories differs according to sex, I use conditional statements to check if the user&#39;s sex is female or male. The selected condition will then run the appropriate formula. I then grab the place in the frontend where I want to display the maximum daily calorie intake of the user. Before displaying the result using &quot;.innerHTML&quot; I first &quot;console.log()&quot; each value for debugging purposes. Then I display the maximum daily calorie intake along with some helpful text for the user. . Testing . For the testing, I will select the procedure of the food table. Below is the code for that: | The first call is of when the user has eaten an apple: . The second call is of when the user has eaten a banana: . I can use my own age, height, weight, gender, and activeness to find my max amount of calories and test if the app is making me healthier. . | The results of each call are shown in the images above. . |",

            "content": "Computing Bias . Google “What age groups use Facebook” vs “… TikTok”? What does the data say? Is there purposeful exclusion in these platforms? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? The data says that Facebook&#39;s age range is around 25-30 years of age, and those much older. TikTok&#39;s range is mostly ranging from 7-25 years. Exclusion by convention and stereotyping are present in these platforms. A divide between two generations using different platforms could be a harmful effect of the platforms&#39; age ranges. Correcting it would have diversity in age in the platform. . Why do virtual assistants have female voices? Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri. Was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business? A lot of reasons for virtual assistants being female include the preferance of a woman assistant over a man, the better and easier to understand sound of a woman&#39;s voice over a man, and customers simply prefer a female voice over a male. It does promote implicit sexism, meaning that the association to a woman&#39;s role in society to a secretarial job or assistant grows because of this. Correcting this, by changing a lot of the voices to male, may not be good business in this day and age, but .

What I click or view is taken by FAANG and used to produce more content for me to consume, which, in turn, influences decisions of mine. . Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional? The owner of the computer did indeed think this was intentional. His exact words were, &quot;I&#39;m sayin&#39; it. Hewlett-Packard computers are racist. I said it!&quot; . How do you think this happened? Usually, companies will send out surveys online asking users if they want to help test beta technology. The sample they picked from the overall population of users was not diverse enough in race, meaning that the facial recognition software was flawed. . Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude? This is very harmful. A diverse group of people will be purchasing HP laptops with this technology, and because of the flaw, a lot of darker-skinned people will be excluded from this software. . Should it be corrected? Yes . What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome? I would, from the sample size gathered from the survey, choose a more diverse group of people myself, not just at random. . Crowdsourcing . We have all experienced Crowdsourcing by using external data through API’s, namely RapidAPI. This data has influenced how we code and shown possibilities in obtaining and analyzing data. Discuss APIs you have used. The only API I have used so far is an API on motivational quotes. It does not use a lot of crowdsourcing, but some API&#39;s that could be created from crowdsourcing are those that give data that requires sampling from a population. . We have all participated in code Crowdsourcing by using GitHub. Many of you have forked from the Teacher repository, or exchanged code with fellow students. Not only can we analyze GitHub code, but we can obtain profiles and history about the persons coding history. What is the biggest discovery you have found in GitHub? One of the biggest discoveries about GitHub I have found is GitHub in its entirety. A freemium software that allows for commit changes through another IDE, has commands compatible with Shell code, allows for version control itself, which is a really useful concept, and the power of its ability for anyone to code what they want is fascinating to me. . Kaggle datasets for code and science exploration. The avenue of data points us youtube or netflix channels. Analyzing crowd data helps us make decisions. Exam top 10 to 20. Did you see anything interesting? The top three trending ones were, in order, the top movies and directors of the US film industry, the arrests made in Chicago from 2014 till now, and a dataset relating video games, crime, and dropping out of school. . Hacks . CompSci has 150 ish principles students. Describe a crowdsource idea and how you might initiate it in our environment? My feature is a nutrition feature. Some data I could collect is through crowdsourcing is asking the source or sample to look on the nutrition label on their lunches, and input some of the important values, such as calories. . What about Del Norte crowdsourcing? Could your project be better with crowdsourcing? Yes. Getting data from everyone in Del Norte will make the application more fit for Del Norte. Actually, that is a good point about sampling: the more data collected from a population, the better fit the result is for the population (in the case of an application or PBL). . What kind of data could you capture at N@tM to make evening interesting? Perhaps use this data to impress Teachers during finals week. I believe that the school food is not exactly the best food, and a lot of the choices the average high schooler makes regarding nutrition are not always the best. Therefore, data showing the nutritional data of Del Norte&#39;s food will most likely grab attention. .",

This enables developers to reference/get instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name versus object.get_name()) | @name.setter decorator (aka setter). This enables developers to update/set instance data in a shorthand fashion (object.name = &quot;John&quot; versus object.set_name(&quot;John&quot;)) | observe all instance data (self._name, self.email ...) are prefixed with &quot;&quot;, this convention allows setters and getters to work with more natural variable name (name, email ...) | . | .

I should have done this the minute I found one of my tools not working and the solution was to do exactly that. Mr. Mortensen told me two things over the course of that time: He told me that experimentation is necessary to succeed, and that I should be able to experiment without him supervising all the time. The second thing he told me was that I felt the need to restrict myself, which I analyzed and found one thing to be the cause: procrastination. I put off re-installing and experimenting with environments for months, and that was a wrong thing to do. But yesterday, I just woke up and went straight to doing it. Mr. Mortensen also once let me know that he bought a fresh windows machine and did the installations working first try. After I did the installations, I felt so good. Not only did I just get over fear built on procrastination, but I actually understood what I was doing this time. On Week 0, I was just following instructions, however poorly. This time, I knew all the vocabulary - I knew that we were installing VsCode through the Ubuntu environment, cloning our repositories, and installing the proper kernels needed to complete work in the class. . My advice to people? Stop procrastinating. The only way to do that is to just do it. Everyone is different, and there is a switch that clicks in the brain that allows for us to just do it, and once I clicked and was done with it, I felt so good and satisfied .",

After taking the test, I answered 50 questions on programming problem-solving as well as computer science connection knowledge (API&#39;s, protocols, how data is shared, etc.). I got 48 of them correct. . The first question I got wrong was about how information is transferred over the Internet. I chose the answer, &quot;The message is broken into two packets. One packet contains the data to be transmitted and the other packet contains metadata for routing the data to the recipient’s device.&quot; The correct answer was, &quot;The message is broken into packets. The packets can be received in any order and still be reassembled by the recipient’s device.&quot; The reason I did not get this correct is because of my lack of knowledge on the subject. This was under a unit that I apparently did not study very well, and caused me to get the answer wrong. My plan to improve in the future is to study and quiz myself and have my friends quiz me on questions that are not cheating on tests. . The second question that I got wrong was the question, &quot;Consider the following code segment. What are the values of first and second as a result of executing the code segment?&quot; The code looked like this: . first = True second = False second = first first = second . I picked the answer, &quot;The value of first is false, and the value of second is true.&quot; As shown below by printing both values, that answer was wrong. . first = True second = False second = first first = second print(first) print(second) . True True . This is a logic proven by a concept called variable swapping. The following code incorrectly swaps variables. . def swap(x, y): x = y y = x print(str(x) + &quot;, &quot; +str(y)) a = 4 b = 2 swap(a, b) . 2, 2 . This is because when x is set to y, x loses its original value, setting both values equal to the original value of y. The following code swaps variables correctly. . def swap(x, y): temp = x x = y y = temp print(str(x) + &quot;, &quot; + str(y)) a = 4 b = 2 swap(a, b) . 2, 4 .

It was only for one trimester and all we did was scratch coding but it was honestly fun. It got me more interested than I already was now that I had somewhat of an idea on what it was. My first and I think only project in scratch was a replica of space invaders. It honestly worked pretty well and I was proud of it, but after that trimester I didn&#39;t touch coding for a few years. I never lost interest, I just had other extracurriculars that took the spot instead. in 11th grade (now) I decided to take csp. I have no idea what I want to do after school as a job and coding seems the most interesting to me. I found this website in 10th grade that taught a little coding but I forgot it&#39;s name. Right now I&#39;m kinda clueless in this class and I&#39;m not sure if I&#39;m doing the right things in this class but after trying to figure out a piece of code for fun I think I&#39;m confident in my choice of this class. I&#39;ll work hard to be able to understand everything going on in this class so I can focus on coding things I enjoy in the future :) . Haoxuan&#39;s Story in Programming . Hi, my name is Haoxuan Tong, and here is a recount of my programming experiences so far. . I started my journey in programming in middle school, where I followed a python guide book to make some small programs such as a random number guessing game and a cypher encode and decoder. Then I attended a course to make several games such as minesweeper and reversi using the tkinter python module. In High School, I attended course to do competitional programming and was able to pass the USACO Bronze division . Now I&#39;m both taking the APCSP course and learning C++ to pass USACO Silver this year. The course so far had been pretty fun, and learning to make websites with github is pretty interesting. I will try to learn more in the future. . Paaras&#39; Story in Programming . As of right now, I am fluent in six programming languages, those being Java, Python, C#, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Whether that is impressive or not, it did take a journey to get to where I am now. From a young age, I had a passion to create. I knew that whatever it is that I wanted to do with my life, I wanted to create something, anything, that people could enjoy together. My dad found himself working in job that was reliant on computer science, and he did his best to pass his skills to me. Therefore, I started to learn Python at a young age, and around seven, I had a very basic understanding of how programming in Python worked. But, like a lot of programmers in a single-digit age, I started out block coding in Scratch. This programming in Scratch and little knowledge in Python continued for a while. When middle school started, I found myself in a programming club after school, and that is where I started to expand my knowledge of programming. I finished the basics of Python, leaving me with the skills to be fluent enough in the language. Then, I self-taught myself HTML, JavaScript, then CSS. After that, I moved to C++, then back to Python for a while, then Java, to C#, then after C#, I moved on to 6 different languages that I eventually forgot. After sitting with these languages for a while, I came across the means to start making video games with the programming knowledge I had. I followed courses and books on these, and won a few competitions with my new game development skills. After that, I stopped programming for a while, and the only programming I did was solving problems on a competitive level every week or so. I then joined AP Computer Science Principles, hoping to put my programming skills to better use, and I hope to use the skills I learn in this class and do more in the future. . While on the path I took, there are some things you learn. For example, don&#39;t be a programmer. Programming languages are just tools to do bigger things. Being fluent in a wide array of languages is like being able to use a lot of construction tools, like hammers and wrenches. Be a problem solver. Demonstrate that you can use the tools, the programming languages, to do bigger things, such as create things, solve problems, and make differences. Thank you for listening to our stories, and good luck with your journey! .",

Our idea was a motivational quotes app. We got this by browsing around RapidAPI and seeing the different API&#39;s we could base our app off of. We found many API&#39;s on motivational quotes, so we did that. Our app had many bugs, however. First of all, we did not have a clear understanding of the API system and how it worked, which set us back. Secondly, some of the features did not work. Our front end was also made with too much haste, causing our app to fail in a lot of places. Our presentation, however (done by me), went pretty well. Overall, I liked the experience and because of the mistakes we made, I know exactly all what I need to do to succeed in the liater . APCSA . The people in that class did something similar to APCSP, but the difference was that since CSA was a level higher than CSP, their applications were required to be more complex.

I&#39;m glad you asked. This gives me an opportunity to bring up a point that is important about data abstraction. When programmers say that lists make code easier, others think that lists are the key to have a relaxing time programming. This is a completely wrong thing to think, because programs, regardless of lists, can still be hard to code. Abstraction, despite the misconceptions, don&#39;t make code easier, but rather, they make code less prone to errors, which is commonly referred to as making it &quot;simpler.&quot; Something I&#39;ve found while doing the hacks for this lesson. | Make your own list the “long and slow way” then manage the complexity of the list | . food1 = &quot;pizza&quot; food2 = &quot;hot dog&quot; food3 = &quot;sushi&quot; food4 = &quot;strawberry&quot; food5 = &quot;sandwich&quot; foods = [food1, food2, food3, food4, food5] print(foods) .

One can think of a boolean as a button: When it is on, it returns true, and when it is off, it returns false, as shown below: . Boolean . Text . Booleans are compatible with something called relational operators. This means that booleans can be compared to each other with said relational operators, shown in the code below: . if 1 == 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Not equal to&quot; checks if two booleans do not have the same value. if 1 != 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Greater than&quot; checks if a boolean is greater than another. if 1 &gt; 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Less than&quot; checks if a boolean is less than another. if 1 &lt; 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Greater than or equal to&quot; checks if a boolean is greater than or equal to another if 1 &gt;= 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) # The operator &quot;Less than&quot; checks if a boolean is less than or equal to another. if 1 &lt;= 0: print(&quot;True&quot;) else: print(&quot;False&quot;) . False True True False True False . Any condition in an &quot;if&quot; statement is technically a boolean. In the code above, &quot;1 &lt;= 0&quot; was a boolean that has the value of False, since the number 1 is neither less than or equal to the number 0. However, it should be mentioned that in programming, boolean works for all variable types, such as a string, as shown in the code below: . first_message = &quot;Hello World&quot; second_message = &quot;Hello, World!&quot; if first_message == second_message: print(&quot;The two messages are the same&quot;) else: print(&quot;The two messages are not the same&quot;) .

Our purpose has changed a total of _ times. We were first a product placement for milk, then a nutrition promotion website, then a product placement of KFC, then finally we became Inspirivational. My grade dropped in this class, and so did our teams. But while I was working to get my scores up, I realized something. While failing is not a pleasant thing to do, in a way, I&#39;m glad I did. There were indeed those who rejected me because of my failures, but I realized that because our team was at the bottom, the only way to go was to the top. So I made the promise to my teacher that I will use what I have learned in the class to use my time wisely and finish everything on time, with all instructions complete. I also promised my teacher that I will give my best and most visible effort to having a strong finish in this trimester.

            "content": "Intro to Engineering: . Engineering is the concept of using scientific and mathematic principles to solve problems. There are many types of engineering. There&#39;s mechanical, software, civil, aeronautical, biotech, and so much more. Each branch interests different people, and the speakers did mention the process of elimination. Every person has their own experiences in learning engineering, so we can all learn from each other. In this presentation, the speakers highlight women in science. There are still a lot of places where women are unfairly not taken seriously in engineering. But with engineers, it takes anyone, no matter who, to take an interest in any of the branches of engineering. Like many other concepts, engineering takes dedication, passion, and hard work, and those who feel happy doing it will excel in it. I asked the question, &quot;What universities specialize in software engineering? In those universities, what are the majors that would help me learn the necessary skills and concepts to get a software developer job in tech app companies (Google, Amazon, Apple, Qualcomm)? What should I do in high school to increase my chances to get admitted into them?&quot; The answer I got from one of the speakers was academic rigor. Besides the SAT and ACT, going above in beyond in school, meaning: taking AP classes relevant to software engineering, participating in clubs relevant to S.E, taking relevant courses at the school&#39;s associated community college, and more. I am currently doing all of these, but it was nice to hear that I am doing the right things, and motivating to listen to. Another question I had was, &quot;I am at a point where I am fluent in about 7 programming languages, and have a good understanding of problem solving - understanding the problem and also understanding what concepts are needed to solve them (I think that&#39;s correct). I actually moved to this city just in July, one of the reasons being the opportunities present in engineering. What are some competitions that I can participate in where I can apply what I&#39;ve learned?&quot; The answers I got was taking part in the robotics club at my school, and also looking into the local companies to see if they hire high schoolers as interns, student employees, etc. Overall, I really liked this presentation, and I am excited for the next one. . Intersections of Business and STEM at Qualcomm: . There are three tenets to the business and stem: The first is to stay curious. A growth mindset, especially in STEM and business at a place like Qualcomm, will take a STEM student very far. One in this field must expose themselves to every field in STEM before choosing one career path. Doing this also helps to land dream jobs. The second, as I recall it, was to not give up. There will be many difficulties in the STEM career process, but one must keep perservering, because that perserverance will always pay off in the end. The third and final tenet is the difference between invention and innovation. Invention is creating something unique. Innovation is the tenet of looking at the end during the beginning. That means identifying a goal that can be achieved with the skills one has, and solving problems to achieve the goal. The presentation was really fun, and I made sure to participate during the presentation. I learned a lot about the fundamental skills of STEM and business in working with a company such as Qualcomm. .",

I personally think we should change it, but I also want to challenge myself to market something that I don&#39;t fully believe in, to better test my promotion and marketing skills. We may change our purpose in the future, but for now, this is our purpose . | Data Abstraction, Managing Complexity, and Procedural Abstraction - With the use of JSON API&#39;s, we store data relevant to our purpose to use later for both frontend and backend development . | Algorithm Implimentation - We are planning on using algorithms to make interactive features on our application that will help the user get hooked to purchasing from KFC . | Testing - As the DevOps, I will make sure that the application is ready for deployment once Scrum Master Samarth and I come to a stage where we feel that it is indeed ready. . | .",

Go deeper into APIs . Web Development vs Jupyter Notebook. A notebook is certainly a great place to start. But, for your end of Trimester project we want you to build the skill to reference and use APIs within your Project. Here are some resources to get you started with this journey. .

An API and a little coding logic will be a big step toward getting meaningful data for a project. There are many API providers, find one that might work for your project to complete this hack. When picking an API you are looking for something that will work with either JavaScript Fetch or Python Request. Here are some samples, these are not qualified in any way. . RapidAPI- GitHub Project | No Key APIs Article | Twitter Developer | Google Developer | Reddit Developer | . Show API and format results in either Web Page or Jupyter Notebook. Ultimately, I will expect that we do APIs in backend (Python/Flask). However, for this Hack you can pick your preference. We will discuss pros and cons in next API tech talk. .",

With fastpages you can save your jupyter notebooks into the _notebooks folder at the root of your repository, and they will be automatically be converted to Jekyll compliant blog posts! . Front Matter . The first cell in your Jupyter Notebook or markdown blog post contains front matter. Front matter is metadata that can turn on/off options in your Notebook. It is formatted like this: . # &quot;My Title&quot; &gt; &quot;Awesome summary&quot; - toc:true- branch: master - badges: true - comments: true - author: Hamel Husain &amp; Jeremy Howard - categories: [fastpages, jupyter] . Setting toc: true will automatically generate a table of contents | Setting badges: true will automatically include GitHub and Google Colab links to your notebook. | Setting comments: true will enable commenting on your blog post, powered by utterances. | . The title and description need to be enclosed in double quotes only if they include special characters such as a colon. More details and options for front matter can be viewed on the front matter section of the README. . Markdown Shortcuts . A #hide comment at the top of any code cell will hide both the input and output of that cell in your blog post. . A #hide_input comment at the top of any code cell will only hide the input of that cell. . The comment #hide_input was used to hide the code that produced this. . put a #collapse-hide flag at the top of any cell if you want to hide that cell by default, but give the reader the option to show it: . import pandas as pd import altair as alt . . put a #collapse-show flag at the top of any cell if you want to show that cell by default, but give the reader the option to hide it: . cars = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/cars.json&#39; movies = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/movies.json&#39; sp500 = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/sp500.csv&#39; stocks = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/stocks.csv&#39; flights = &#39;https://vega.github.io/vega-datasets/data/flights-5k.json&#39; . . place a #collapse-output flag at the top of any cell if you want to put the output under a collapsable element that is closed by default, but give the reader the option to open it: . print(&#39;The comment #collapse-output was used to collapse the output of this cell by default but you can expand it.&#39;) .

This guide provides more detail about this syntax, which looks like this: . For example, here is a footnote {% fn 1 %}. And another {% fn 2 %} {{ &#39;This is the footnote.&#39; | fndetail: 1 }} {{ &#39;This is the other footnote. You can even have a [link](www.github.com)!&#39; | fndetail: 2 }} .

Where YEAR is a four-digit number, MONTH and DAY are both two-digit numbers, and filename is whatever file name you choose, to remind yourself what this post is about. .md is the file extension for markdown files. . The first line of the file should start with a single hash character, then a space, then your title. This is how you create a “level 1 heading” in markdown. Then you can create level 2, 3, etc headings as you wish but repeating the hash character, such as you see in the line ## File names above. . Basic formatting . You can use italics, bold, code font text, and create links. Here’s a footnote 1. Here’s a horizontal rule: . . Lists . Here’s a list: . item 1 | item 2 | . And a numbered list: . item 1 | item 2 | Boxes and stuff . This is a quotation . . You can include alert boxes …and… . . You can include info boxes Images . . Code . You can format text and code per usual . General preformatted text: . # Do a thing do_thing() . Python code and output: . # Prints &#39;2&#39; print(1+1) . 2 .
