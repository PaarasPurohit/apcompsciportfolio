    "\n",
    "1. What is nesting in SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Nesting refers to the practice of nesting CSS rules within other CSS rules, which allows for more organized and hierarchical styling of HTML elements. Nesting is one of the features of SASS that makes it a powerful and efficient CSS preprocessor. SASS allows you to write CSS rules in a nested structure, where child selectors are written inside their parent selectors. This creates a visual hierarchy that is easier to read and understand, and also helps to avoid repetitive code.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What are similarities and differences you notice about the buttons?\n",
    "\n",
    "The buttons are all the same width and height, but they are different colors and one of them is a radial gradient.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. What is extending and inheritance in SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "Extending or inheritance is a feature that allows you to define a CSS rule or selector with common styles, and then extend or inherit those styles in other CSS rules or selectors. This helps in creating reusable styles and reduces code duplication. In SASS, you can use the @extend directive to extend a CSS rule or selector from one place to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. What is a Mixin in SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "A mixin is a reusable block of code that can be defined once and then included or \"mixed in\" to multiple CSS rules or selectors. Mixins in SASS are similar to functions or procedures in programming languages, allowing you to define a block of styles and then reuse it in multiple places in your CSS code. Mixins in SASS are defined using the @mixin directive, and they can accept parameters, allowing you to create dynamic styles.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. What is a function in SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is a reusable piece of code that can be defined once and then called with arguments to perform calculations or generate values dynamically. Functions in SASS are similar to functions in programming languages and can be used to create dynamic styles or perform calculations on values. SASS provides a set of built-in functions, such as rgb(), rgba(), darken(), lighten(), mix(), round(), percentage(), etc., which can be used to perform various operations on color values, numeric values, strings, and other data types. In addition to the built-in functions, SASS allows you to define your own custom functions using the @function directive.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. What is importing in SASS?\n",
    "\n",
    "The @import directive is used to include the contents of one SASS file into another. It is a way to modularize your CSS code and split it into separate files for better organization, reusability, and maintainability. The @import directive allows you to include the styles from one SASS file into another, similar to how you might use import in other programming languages. When the SASS compiler processes a file with an @import directive, it imports the contents of the specified file and combines them into a single CSS output."

You can **add, subtract, multiply, and divide** arrays, just like you would with regular numbers.

This makes it easy to perform operations on large amounts of data quickly and efficiently.\n",

    "Numpy provides a convenient and powerful way to perform data analysis tasks on **large datasets**. One of the most common tasks in data analysis is finding the **mean, median, and standard deviation** of a dataset. Numpy provides functions to perform these operations quickly and easily. The mean function calculates the average value of the data, while the median function calculates the middle value in the data. The standard deviation function calculates how spread out the data is from the mean. Additionally, numpy provides functions to find the minimum and maximum values in the data. These functions are very useful for gaining insight into the properties of large datasets and can be used for a wide range of data analysis tasks."
