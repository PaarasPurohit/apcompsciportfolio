    "        - A list and a dictionary are considered collection types rather than primitive types. Primitive types in Python include fundamental data types such as integers, floating-point numbers, booleans, and strings. These types are indivisible and have a fixed size in memory. They are not built from other types but are considered atomic values.\n",

    "        - In Python, when a list is passed as an argument to the bubble sort algorithm, it is actually passed by reference, which means it behaves as a \"pass-by-reference\" scenario. This is because objects in Python, including lists, are mutable, and their references are passed to functions rather than creating a copy of the entire object.\n",

    "In the code above, the selection_sort function sorts the input array arr using the selection sort algorithm. The array is sorted based on the first element of each item (the key) using comparisons and swaps. The print_data function is used to print the sorted data in a readable format. It iterates over each item in the array and prints the key first, followed by the other elements. You can modify the print statement as per your requirements. In the example usage, we have an input array data containing tuples, each with a key and other elements. The selection_sort function is called to sort the data, and then the sorted data is printed using the print_data function. This shows how my algorithm uses the created list to use selection sort (my expertise sorting algorithm) tested against my sort, and how it uses comparisons, swaps, and the O(n^2) time complexity, as well as printing the data, key, and elements in a viewable form."
