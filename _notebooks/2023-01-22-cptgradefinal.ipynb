    "\n",
    "### Purpose \n",
    " - What problem am I solving?\n",
    " - How am I solving it?\n",
    " - What is the input from the user?\n",
    " - What does the application output?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Abstraction\n",
    " - How does the list in the program store data from the user? \n",
    " - How is it needed by the program? \n",
    " - What is the variable representing the list?\n",
    " - How is the data in the list needed for the program?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Managing Complexity\n",
    " - What code lets the list manage the complexity?\n",
    " - If the list was not used in the program, could the program still work somehow?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Procedural Abstraction\n",
    " - Do I have a code segment that shows my own procedure (with at least one parameter) having an effect on the application's functionality?\n",
    " - Do I have a code segment where said procedure is being called?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Algorithm Implementation\n",
    " - Does my algorithm include sequencing, selection, and iteration?\n",
    " - Have I explained my algorithm in enough detail for another to recreate it?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Testing\n",
    " - Do I have two different calls to the procedure?\n",
    " - Have I described the arguments/conditions for both calls?\n",
    " - Have I described the results of both calls?"
