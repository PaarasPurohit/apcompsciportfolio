    "Fault tolerance in computer science refers to the ability of a system to continue functioning properly in the event of hardware or software failures. It involves designing systems with redundancy and failover mechanisms to minimize the impact of faults. This can include using redundant hardware components or implementing backup software processes to ensure continuous operation. Fault tolerance is especially important in critical systems where failures can have serious consequences, such as in aerospace or medical applications. Achieving fault tolerance typically requires significant investment and expertise, but can provide substantial benefits in terms of reliability and availability.\n",

The communication between the frontend and backend is typically done over the internet, which is a distributed network of interconnected devices and servers.\n",
