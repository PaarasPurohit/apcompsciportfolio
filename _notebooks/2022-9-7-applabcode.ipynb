This is our first app coded with AppLab, and we created a very simple quiz. The language used was JavaScript, a language mainly used for programming HTML behavior. It is famous for having a large amount of libraries, as well.\n",

    "- Program Purpose and Function - The purpose was to create a simple quiz that implemented the CPT Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Abstraction - I used different screens that looked at stored values of \"right\" or \"wrong,\" and output the correct message for the user's answer, whether it was wrong or right.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Managing Complexity - Since this was a quiz, complexity was not always needed, but the code is efficient and does not take too long to run, despite its length.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Procedural Abstraction - The code written for the quiz, I believe, can defintely be applied to other relevant situations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Algorithm Implementation - Using if-else statements and checking what is being inputted when, I was able to create simple algorithms that completed the task.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Testing - There was some syntax error here and there, but no major errors to report."
