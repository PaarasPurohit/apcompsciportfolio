    "I only got question 21 wrong. One of my answers was to sort by subject, then sort by year, then filter by photographer. This, however, is incorrect. This sequence of steps does not remove any entries with an unknown year, so the entry in the first row of the spreadsheet will have a year value of -1. The correct answer was to sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer. This option is correct, because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet."
