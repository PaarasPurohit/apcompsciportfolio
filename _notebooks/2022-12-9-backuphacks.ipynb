    "- *Why are using lists better for a program, rather than writing out each line of code?* I'm glad you asked. This gives me an opportunity to bring up a point that is important about data abstraction. When programmers say that lists make code easier, others think that lists are the key to have a relaxing time programming. This is a completely wrong thing to think, because programs, regardless of lists, can still be hard to code. Abstraction, despite the misconceptions, don't make code easier, but rather, they make code less prone to errors, which is commonly referred to as making it \"simpler.\" Something I've found while doing the hacks for this lesson.\n",
