    "# Overview\n",
    "My feature is essentially a calorie counter with two parts to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first is a calorie counter that needs user data to output the amount of calories burned in a day. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second is a feature that inputs a food and its calories to make a list of foods, and can calculate the total amount of calories consumed. It will also warn the user when they are close to going over their calorie limit.\n",
    "\n",
    "The value that will be stored in their user account is the max calorie count for that user."

    "# Purpose:\n",
    "1. The purpose of the overall feature is to solve the problem of an unhealthy lifestyle by calculating daily calorie intake and managing it.\n",
    "2. For the first part, using a formula for metabolic rate, depending on the gender, the program will use the user's age, sex, weight, height, and activity level and produce the output of the user's maximum calories, letting the user have the option to save this value to their account. For the second part, the program will use the inputs of food name and calorie amount and output a table showing the summative foods put through the day.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. For the first part, the input is the integers sex, age, weight, height, and the multiple-choice activity level (later stored as an integer) of the user. The output is the maximum calories the user can consume daily. For the second part, the input is the name of a food being consumed, and the amount of calories in it. The output is a table showing every food entered in that day, as well as the calories of them all."

    "# Data Abstraction\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The table created acts as a list for both frontend and backend. Food name and calorie amount variables are stored in said table. The sum of the calorie amounts is used to calculate whether or not the user should stop calorie consumption for the day, as shown in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The list is the table creation and adding of rows itself, as shown in the code below.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The data of the food's name is simply for the user to identify where each calorie amount comes from, but the calorie amounts are added together to check if the user is going over their daily maximum calorie consumption, as shown in the code below.\n",

    "If this were not here, the user could not keep track of their daily calorie consumption, meaning that the feature establishes the maximum calorie consumption for the user, but does not help manage the user's consumption to fit said max calories. The only other way to achieve such a management section would be to create variables for every possible entry, which would be inefficient and a waste of data."

    "1. There are functions to fetch a JSON list from a user database. The name of the database is the URL inputted into the fetch() method.

Since the formula for calculating maximum calories differs according to sex, I use conditional statements to check if the user's sex is female or male. The selected condition will then run the appropriate formula. I then grab the place in the frontend where I want to display the maximum daily calorie intake of the user. Before displaying the result using \".innerHTML\" I first \"console.log()\" each value for debugging purposes. Then I display the maximum daily calorie intake along with some helpful text for the user."
