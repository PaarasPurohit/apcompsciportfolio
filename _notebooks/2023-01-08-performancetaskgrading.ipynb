    "The purpose should either be a passion that is being pursued through the project, or a problem being solved through the project. A better purpose would probably be an app that helps students with complex trigonometry calculations, or the developer's passion for trigonometry being expressed through the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Managing Complexity was not achieved due to unecessary and inaccurate answers in the written response. This could be improved on by making the code more efficient at the ending stages of the project. In the last couple weeks, students should analyze code and how it should be simplified to manage complexity. This means more organized lists, dictionaries, even simply organized code, and more.\n",

    "Submission II, as well as from CollegeBoard, gets full marks from me as well. It completes each row's instructions and is accurate in its detail."
